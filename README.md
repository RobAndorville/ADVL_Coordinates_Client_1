The Andorville™ Coordinates Client software demonstrates the exchange of information with the Coordinates application through the Application Network.

The Coordinates Client application is written in Visual Basic 2015.

The program uses the Andorville™ Utilities class library.

The Application Network and Coordinates application must be running and connected to the network before the Coordinates Client can perform coordinate conversions.
